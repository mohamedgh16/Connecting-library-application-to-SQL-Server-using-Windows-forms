### Introduction

windows forms is one of the best tools used in making applications.
With windows forms, you can make a variety of applications, from a mini calculator to a library application that connects to a database. In this tutorial, we will connect a library application using Windows forms to a database using SQL Server.

In this tutorial, we will use a windows forms project and work on it, we will add new forms that will add edit & delete books from the library, we will also manage the authors, the stores & the publishers stored in the database. We will display the information of each attribute & refresh it each time a change accrues.
